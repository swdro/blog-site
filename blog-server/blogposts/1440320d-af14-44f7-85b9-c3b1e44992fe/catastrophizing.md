[[ego]]

This is an egotistic action. When one catastrophizes, they project the past onto the future. This is greatly related to the ego as the ego is what we identify with and in this case we identify with the past. Our past isn't what defines us. Ideally, we don't want to identify with anything as identifying will require us to feed that identification indefinitely and when we cannot feed It, we become unhappy leading to disappointment within ourselves. Thus, It is wrong to associate ourselves with the past. Instead, associate with the NOW. The now is the best depiction of yourself and your ego is what prevents you from expressing yourself freely because the ego induces fear so that you stay comfortable and complacent. Your ego doesn't want you to grow and wants you to continue catastrophizing. To kill the ego is to disregard It and thrive.
